# HERE Mobile SDK 3.x for Android example projects

Copyright (c) 2011-2020 HERE Europe B.V.

This repository holds a series of Java-based projects using the **HERE Mobile SDK 3.x for Android**. More information about the API can be found on the HERE Developer Portal's [Mobile SDKs](https://developer.here.com/develop/mobile-sdks) page.

This set of individual, use-case based projects is designed to be cloned by developers for their own use.

**Note:** In order to be able to build the examples, you have to [sign up](https://developer.here.com/develop/mobile-sdks?create=Evaluation&keepState=true&step=account) for a *90-day Free Trial*. After signing in with a *HERE account*, follow these steps to download the *HERE Mobile SDK (Premium)*:

1. Choose to *Generate App ID and App Code* for use with the *HERE Mobile SDK for Android*:
![Generate App ID and App Code](/.screenshots/Premium%20SDK%20-%20Generate%20App%20ID%20and%20App%20Code.png?raw=true)

2. Enter the package name of the example you want to build, e.g. [com.here.android.example.map.basic](https://github.com/heremaps/here-android-sdk-examples/blob/master/map-rendering/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L3). **The package name entered here must match the name in your app**:
![Enter package name](/.screenshots/Premium%20SDK%20-%20Enter%20package%20name.png?raw=true)

3. Click on *GENERATE* to obtain the App ID, App Code, and License Key:
![Enter package name](/.screenshots/Premium%20SDK%20-%20Generated%20license.png?raw=true)

4. Click on *Download SDK* to get a files named like `HERE_Android_SDK_Premium_v3.16.2_101.zip` (your version number might differ).

5. Extract `HERE_Android_SDK_Premium_v3.16.2_101.zip` as well as the contained `HERE-sdk.zip`.

6. Copy the contained `HERE-sdk/libs/HERE-sdk.aar` file to your example's `libs` directory. Again taking the *map-rendering* example, the `libs` directory would be [here](https://github.com/heremaps/here-android-sdk-examples/tree/master/map-rendering/app/libs).

7. Replace the instances of the `{YOUR_APP_ID}`, `{YOUR_APP_CODE}` and `{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}` placeholders in the example's `AndroidManifest.xml` with your obtained values. Yet again looking at the *map-rendering* examples, this would be [here](https://github.com/heremaps/here-android-sdk-examples/blob/master/map-rendering/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L29), [here](https://github.com/heremaps/here-android-sdk-examples/blob/master/map-rendering/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L32) and [here](https://github.com/heremaps/here-android-sdk-examples/blob/master/map-rendering/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L35).

8. Replace the instances of the `{YOUR_LABEL_NAME}` placeholders in the example's `AndroidManifest.xml` with your own custom values. Do not reuse HERE Mobile SDK defaults.

9. Launch [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and import the example's `build.gradle` file..

10. Run the app.
