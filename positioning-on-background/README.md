# Map Positioning

## Prerequisites

Update manifest file with proper license key as described above in root [README file](../README.md).

## Purpose

Gives a simple example of HERE Positioning usage without UI. More details in [Positioning Documentation](https://developer.here.com/documentation/android-premium/dev_guide/topics/positioning-intro.html).

## Example

Displays current position and some meta information: method of currently obtained coordinates, speed, etc,
when activity is showing. After closing the activity positioning updates are preserved with foreground service.
